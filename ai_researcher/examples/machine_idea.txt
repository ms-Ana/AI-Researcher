Title: Adaptive Prompting: Customizing Prompts for Improved Factuality and Reduced Hallucination in Large Language Models

1. Problem Statement: Existing prompting methods often rely on fixed prompts that do not adapt to the specific characteristics or difficulty of the input, leading to suboptimal performance and increased risk of hallucinations.

2. Motivation: Current prompting approaches typically use a fixed set of prompts for all inputs, regardless of their complexity or domain. Some methods attempt to customize prompts based on input features, but they often require extensive manual engineering or domain-specific knowledge. Adapting prompts to the specific characteristics of each input can help LLMs generate more accurate and consistent responses. By dynamically selecting or generating prompts based on the input's complexity, domain, or other relevant features, we can guide LLMs to focus on the most important aspects of the problem and reduce the risk of hallucinations.

3. Proposed Method: We propose Adaptive Prompting (AP), a dynamic prompting approach that customizes prompts based on the characteristics of each input. The key steps include:
    (1) Extracting relevant features from the input, such as its complexity, domain, or topic.
    (2) Selecting or generating a suitable prompt based on these features, using a meta-learning model trained on a diverse set of prompts and their performance on various inputs.
    (3) Applying the selected prompt to guide the LLM in generating a response.
    (4) Evaluating the quality of the generated response using metrics that capture factuality, consistency, and relevance.
    (5) Updating the meta-learning model based on the performance of the selected prompt to improve future prompt selection.

4. Step-by-Step Experiment Plan: 
    - Step 1: Gather Datasets: Evaluate AP on diverse benchmarks that cover multiple domains and difficulty levels, such as MultiNLI (for natural language inference), DecaNLP (for multi-task question answering), and MMLU (for multi-domain multiple choice questions). These datasets contain inputs with varying complexity and domain, making them suitable for testing the effectiveness of adaptive prompting.
    - Step 2: Construct Prompts: 
        (1) Collect a diverse set of prompts for each dataset, covering different styles, lengths, and levels of specificity. For example, for MultiNLI, include prompts like "Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by, contradicted by, or neutral to the premise," "Does the hypothesis follow logically from the premise? Yes, No, or Maybe," and "Premise: [premise] Hypothesis: [hypothesis] The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is:".
        (2) Train a meta-learning model (e.g., a neural network) to predict the performance of each prompt on a given input based on extracted features. The input features can include the input's length, vocabulary, syntactic complexity, domain-specific keywords, and topic distribution. The meta-learning model is trained on a subset of the data, with the goal of minimizing the loss between the predicted and actual performance of each prompt.
    - Step 3: Select Models: Evaluate AP on state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-002), GPT-4, and PaLM. These models have shown strong performance across various tasks and are widely used in prompting-based approaches.
    - Step 4: Establish Baselines: Compare the performance of AP with the following baselines:
        (1) Fixed prompting: Use a single, manually designed prompt for all inputs in a dataset.
        (2) Random prompting: Randomly select a prompt from the collected set for each input.
        (3) Input-dependent prompting: Use heuristics or simple rules to select prompts based on input features (e.g., using shorter prompts for shorter inputs).
    - Step 5: Evaluate Performance: 
        (1) For each dataset and model, generate responses using AP and the baseline methods.
        (2) Evaluate the quality of the generated responses using metrics that capture factuality (e.g., accuracy on fact-checking datasets like MultiFC), consistency (e.g., entailment score between the input and response), and relevance (e.g., ROUGE score between the input and response).
        (3) Analyze the effectiveness of the meta-learning model in selecting suitable prompts for different types of inputs by comparing the performance of AP with the baselines across various input characteristics (e.g., complexity, domain).
    - Step 6: Ablation Studies: 
        (1) Investigate the impact of different input features on the performance of AP by ablating each feature group (e.g., complexity features, domain features) and comparing the results.
        (2) Evaluate the sensitivity of AP to the size and diversity of the prompt set by varying the number and types of prompts used in the meta-learning model.
        (3) Analyze the effect of the meta-learning model's architecture and training procedure on the performance of AP by experimenting with different model designs and hyperparameters.

5. Test Case Examples: 
    - Test Case 1: 
        - Input: Premise: The old man walked slowly across the room. Hypothesis: The man moved quickly.
        - Baseline Prompt: Determine if the hypothesis is entailed by, contradicted by, or neutral to the premise.
        - Baseline Output: Neutral
        - AP Prompt: Premise: The old man walked slowly across the room. Hypothesis: The man moved quickly. Does the hypothesis contradict the premise? Yes or No.
        - AP Output: Yes
        - Explanation: The baseline prompt is too general and does not focus on the key aspect of the input, which is the contradiction between "slowly" and "quickly." AP selects a more targeted prompt that directly asks about the contradiction, leading to the correct output.
    - Test Case 2: 
        - Input: What is the capital of France?
        - Baseline Prompt: Answer the following question:
        - Baseline Output: Paris is the capital of France.
        - AP Prompt: What is the capital city of the country France? Provide a brief, factual answer.
        - AP Output: Paris.
        - Explanation: The baseline prompt is generic and does not provide any guidance on the desired response format. AP selects a prompt that emphasizes brevity and factuality, resulting in a concise and accurate output.

6. Fallback Plan: If AP does not outperform the baselines, consider alternative approaches such as analyzing and improving prompt quality through different prompt engineering techniques. Investigate alternative input features or feature extraction methods to better capture relevant characteristics. Explore various meta-learning architectures or training procedures to enhance the prompt selection model's performance. Conduct a detailed error analysis to identify problematic inputs or prompts, guiding further improvements. If results remain unsatisfactory, analyze the relationship between input characteristics, prompt properties, and output quality to gain insights for designing new prompting approaches or understanding current limitations.

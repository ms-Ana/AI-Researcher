Title: Privacy-Preserving Prompt Filtering: Enabling Large Language Models to Protect Sensitive Information
Problem Statement: "Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate outputs that reveal sensitive information about the training data or the individuals represented in it, raising significant privacy concerns in domains such as healthcare, finance, and personal communication.",
Motivation: "Existing approaches to preserving privacy in LLMs, such as differential privacy, federated learning, and post-processing techniques like text sanitization, often require significant computational overhead and can degrade the model's utility. We propose a novel prompting strategy that enables LLMs to filter out privacy-sensitive information from their outputs, without the need for expensive training techniques or post-processing. By leveraging the model's language understanding capabilities, we aim to enable LLMs to dynamically identify and remove sensitive content from their responses.",
Proposed Method: "We introduce Privacy-Preserving Prompt Filtering (PPPF), a flexible and efficient approach that works as follows: 1. Privacy Policy Prompt: We prepend a privacy policy prompt to the input prompt, specifying the types of sensitive information that should be excluded from the output (e.g., personal names, addresses, financial details). 2. Sensitive Content Detection: We use a second prompt to instruct the LLM to identify any sensitive information in its generated response that violates the privacy policy. 3. Content Filtering: If sensitive information is detected, we use a third prompt to instruct the LLM to remove or replace the sensitive content with neutral, non-identifying information. 4. Response Generation: The filtered response is then returned to the user. By using prompts to guide the LLM's content generation and filtering process, PPPF enables the model to dynamically preserve privacy without the need for expensive training techniques or post-processing. This approach leverages the LLM's inherent language understanding capabilities to identify and remove sensitive information in real-time.",
Step-by-Step Experiment Plan: "Step 1: Dataset Selection": "We will evaluate PPPF on a range of language generation tasks that involve potentially sensitive information, such as medical record summarization (e.g., i2b2 NLP Dataset), personal email generation (e.g., Enron Email Dataset), and financial document summarization (e.g., Financial Phrase Bank). These datasets contain real-world examples of text with sensitive information that needs to be protected.", "Step 2: Baseline Methods": "We will compare PPPF to the following baseline methods: 1. Unfiltered Generation: The LLM generates responses without any privacy-preserving measures. 2. Differential Privacy: We will apply differential privacy techniques during the LLM's training process to limit the risk of revealing sensitive information. 3. Text Sanitization: We will post-process the LLM's generated responses using text sanitization techniques, such as named entity recognition and replacement, to remove sensitive information.", "Step 3: Evaluation Metrics": "We will measure the performance of PPPF and the baseline methods using the following metrics: 1. Privacy Preservation: We will manually annotate the generated responses to determine the percentage of outputs that successfully exclude sensitive information, as defined by the privacy policy prompt. 2. Fluency and Coherence: We will use automated metrics, such as perplexity and BLEU score, to assess the fluency and coherence of the generated responses. 3. Content Preservation: We will manually evaluate the generated responses to determine the extent to which the filtered outputs preserve the relevant, non-sensitive information from the original responses.", "Step 4: Prompt Engineering": "We will design a set of privacy policy prompts, sensitive content detection prompts, and content filtering prompts for each dataset. For example, in the medical domain, the privacy policy prompt may specify that personal names, dates of birth, and specific diagnoses should be excluded from the output. The sensitive content detection prompt will instruct the LLM to identify any instances of this information in its generated response, and the content filtering prompt will guide the LLM to replace the sensitive information with neutral, non-identifying alternatives.", "Step 5: Model Selection": "We will evaluate PPPF using state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) and GPT-4 from the OpenAI API. We will compare the performance of these models to determine the impact of model size and architecture on the effectiveness of PPPF.", "Step 6: Experiment Execution": "For each combination of dataset, baseline method, and LLM, we will generate responses to a sample of input prompts. We will apply PPPF to the LLM-generated responses and evaluate the results using the metrics described in Step 3. We will also conduct a qualitative analysis of the filtered outputs to identify any common patterns or challenges in the content filtering process.", "Step 7: Result Analysis": "We will compare the performance of PPPF to the baseline methods across all datasets and LLMs. We will determine the extent to which PPPF improves privacy preservation while maintaining the fluency, coherence, and content preservation of the generated responses. We will also analyze the impact of different prompt engineering strategies on the effectiveness of PPPF."
Test Case Examples: "Example 1": { "Input": "Generate a summary of the patient's medical record.", "Privacy Policy Prompt": "Exclude any personal names, dates of birth, and specific diagnoses from the summary.", "Unfiltered Output": "John Doe, born on 01/01/1980, was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus on 03/15/2020. He has been prescribed metformin to manage his blood sugar levels.", "PPPF Output": "The patient, a 43-year-old male, was recently diagnosed with a chronic metabolic disorder. He has been prescribed medication to manage his condition." }, "Example 2": { "Input": "Generate a summary of the financial report.", "Privacy Policy Prompt": "Exclude any specific financial figures, account numbers, and personally identifiable information from the summary.", "Unfiltered Output": "Acme Inc., account number 1234567890, reported a net profit of $1,500,000 for the fiscal year 2022. The CEO, Jane Smith, attributed the success to the launch of a new product line.", "PPPF Output": "The company reported a substantial net profit for the most recent fiscal year. The CEO attributed the success to the launch of a new product line." }, "Explanation": "In both examples, PPPF successfully identifies and removes sensitive information from the generated responses, as specified by the privacy policy prompts. The filtered outputs maintain the core message of the original responses while protecting the privacy of the individuals and organizations involved."
Fallback Plan: If PPPF does not achieve satisfactory performance in terms of privacy preservation, fluency, coherence, or content preservation, we will explore the following alternative approaches:
Fine-tuning: Instead of relying solely on prompts, we will fine-tune the LLMs on datasets that have been annotated for sensitive information. This may help the models learn to identify and filter sensitive content more effectively.
Hybrid Approaches: We will combine PPPF with other privacy-preserving techniques, such as differential privacy or text sanitization, to create a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of each method.
Iterative Refinement: We will investigate the use of iterative refinement techniques, where the LLM generates multiple candidate responses, and the privacy policy prompts are used to guide the selection of the most privacy-preserving output.
Human Evaluation: We will conduct a more extensive human evaluation of the generated responses to identify the specific challenges and limitations of PPPF. This analysis will inform the development of more advanced prompt engineering strategies or alternative approaches to privacy preservation in LLMs.
